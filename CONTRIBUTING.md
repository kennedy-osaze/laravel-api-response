# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**!

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/kennedy-osaze/laravel-api-response/pulls).

## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)** which has been **[modified](https://github.com/kennedy-osaze/php-cs-fixer-config/blob/main/src/rules.php)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is run command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
